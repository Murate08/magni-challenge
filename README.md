# Technical challenge to create a university website, 

This is a technical project for a university website, in order to understand my coding style, creative solution, use of standards and best practices.

## For this project I used the technologies:
#### React;
#### Firebase;
#### react-redux;
#### react-router-dom;
#### reactstrap;
#### remixicon;
#### framer-motion;
#### bootstrap;





## To access the project, use the link below:
-- https://sweet-centaur-cd6c40.netlify.app

If you want to run porjetco on a personal machine, the repository is available to the public, being able to clone and install the dependencies in the project directory.

### `npm install` 




 The application has a university management interface:
 Where we can access the user registration;
 See all students and filter by course; 
 See all teachers and filter by academic degree;
 Add a student as well as add a teacher;




### Developed by Ayad

#### Note:  I didn't have much time to implement everything required in the project in due time, I would have liked to do more, but I'm going to do the continuous integration of the project, being able to make updates to the project.
